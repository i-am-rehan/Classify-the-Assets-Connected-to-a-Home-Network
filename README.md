# 💻 Classify the Assets Connected to a Home Network  

## 🔒 Overview  
This project focuses on building an **asset inventory** for a home office network used for small business operations. Asset management is a key security practice that ensures devices are tracked, classified, and protected according to their importance and sensitivity. The activity demonstrates how connected devices can be analyzed to highlight risks and prioritize protection.

## 🧩 Process  
1. Identified three devices connected to the home office network (e.g., desktop computer, external hard drive, webcam).  
2. Documented key details for each device:  
   - **Network access** (frequency of use and connectivity)  
   - **Owner** (responsible person)  
   - **Location** (relative to router)  
3. Noted important characteristics in the **Notes** column, such as type of data stored and level of user security awareness.  
4. Classified devices by **sensitivity level** based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.
